# Portofolio ADS minor
### Name: Jesse de lange
### Student number: 19043856

In this portofolio, I will show the progress I made dureing the minor Applied Data Science. During this minor I worked on two different projects:
* FoodBoost
* Cofano Containers

### <a id="reflection-on-own"></a>Reflection on own contribution <!-- omit in toc -->
At the beginning of this minor first tried to connect and bond with the group as much as possible to come up with a specific role for me.
Overall it was easy to bond with the group since everybody over open about there weaknesses and strength.

During the Foodboost project I definitly wanted to contribute to the project with a mathematical part for the project. So I came up with an
Linear Programming model to scedule every predicted meal based on the prediction system the group had made. This model filled in the scedule based on a maximum 
amount of calories and separate predicted lists for meals and dinners. For the maximum amount of calories I contributed a little bit to the research
so we knew what would be the maximum amount of calories for the Linear Programming model.

For the COFANO project I mainly was focussing on collecting knowledge about reinforcement lreaning. I did this using Youtube tutorials and documentation of
different libraries needed. This way I could provide usefull knowledge to the team so they could make convincing choices during the making of the final model. I also could share this knowledge with other research groups of the minor. Below I will reflect on the making of my own reinforcement learning model.  

### **Making a reinforcement learning model by myself** 
#### **Situation** 
To gain knowlegde bout reinforcement learning and contribute to the project, we all had to make a reinforcement learning model by our own from scratch with our own unique method.  

#### **Tast** 
My task was to make an reinforcement learning model using a [tutorial] I found on youtube, with the nessecary [documentation].  

#### **Action**
I watched the whole 3 hour tutorial on youtube to gain information about the used library. Then I made a custom environment on a easy problem that was demonstrated 
in the Youtube tutorial. At last I changed the model to fit he COFANO problem.  

#### **Result**
The result of my work was a working model that could place containers on places where there was no container. Also I gained very much knowledge about the used
library. This was of great value to the work of my teammates and other groups of the minor.  

#### **Reflection**
I am glad that I made a working model that could place containers on empty spaced. The only thing I regret was nog really making an al tweakable agent where
I could finetune the model even further.
