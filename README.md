## <a id="personel-contribution-to-the-projects"></a>Personel contribution to the projects 
At the beginning of this minor first tried to connect and bond with the group as much as possible to come up with a specific role for me.
Overall it was easy to bond with the group since everybody over open about there weaknesses and strength.

During the Foodboost project I definitly wanted to contribute to the project with a mathematical part for the project. So I came up with an
Linear Programming model to scedule every predicted meal based on the prediction system the group had made. This model filled in the scedule based on a maximum 
amount of calories and separate predicted lists for meals and dinners. For the maximum amount of calories I contributed a little bit to the research
so we knew what would be the maximum amount of calories for the Linear Programming model.

For the COFANO project I mainly was focussing on collecting knowledge about reinforcement lreaning. I did this using Youtube tutorials and documentation of
different libraries needed. This way I could provide usefull knowledge to the team so they could make convincing choices during the making of the final model. I also could share this knowledge with other research groups of the minor. Below I will reflect on the making of my own reinforcement learning model.  

### **Making a reinforcement learning model by myself** 
#### **Situation** 
To gain knowlegde bout reinforcement learning and contribute to the project, we all had to make a reinforcement learning model by our own from scratch with our own unique method.  

#### **Task** 
My task was to make an reinforcement learning model using a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mut_u40Sqz4&t=8980s) I found on youtube, with the nessecary [documentation](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/).  

#### **Action**
I watched the whole 3 hour tutorial on youtube to gain information about the used library. Then I made a custom environment on a easy problem that was demonstrated 
in the Youtube tutorial. At last I changed the model to fit he COFANO problem.  

#### **Result**
The result of my work was a working model that could place containers on places where there was no container. Also I gained very much knowledge about the used
library. This was of great value to the work of my teammates and other groups of the minor.  

#### **Reflection**
I am glad that I made a working model that could place containers on empty spaced. The only thing I regret was nog really making an al tweakable agent where
I could finetune the model even further.  

## <a id="personel-learning-objectives"></a>Personel learning objectives
When I started with the minor, I realy wanted to get an introduction to machine learning and neural networks and how to use them in diffenet situations.
I always was very drawn to the concept of machine learning en neural networks like making predictions, self training computers and recognition. for around half a year I had a book where looked into once in a while, but I had no experience what so ever.

During this minor I definitely learnied a lot of things about machine learning and neural networks. I learned the basics of fitting and defining a model, data cleaning/preperation and background knowledge of how such models work. I am also glad that I can do all of this without or with minimal help and use them for my own projects at home or later at work. Below I will reflect on hyperparametertuning the model.  

### **Hyperparametertuning the used model** 
#### **Situation** 
The group made a model and wanted to optimize the results so hyperparameter tuning was needed to make sure all the parameters where correctly defined.

#### **Task** 
Using a study, my tast was to find the optimal hypermarameter settings using the optuna hyperparameter tuning method.

#### **Action**
The first thing I did was following machine learning lessons of the fourth year of my study. In the lessons, different methods of hyperparametertuning where explained and I tried them out for myself so I could get a better undertanding of the optuna library and how to use it. Then when I had enough information, I applied the method to our model and used it to optimize the results.

#### **Result**
At the end, we got the right hyperparameters and the model eventually worked a little bit better.

#### **Reflection**
It maybe felt like cheating but I was glad that I followed the lectures of my study. This way I gained a lot of knowledge about how the hyperparameters influence the model and how I could optimize them to my demand.

## <a id="evaluation-on-group"></a>Evaluation on group
Overall I'm very happy with my group as a whole. The group existed of peaple with different domain knowledges which complimented each other very good. in the beginning we of course needed to know each other, but eventually we became a well oiled machine that was motivated to work on the project.

In the beginning I really had to find my spot within the group. Of course I had my role which was to be the communication bridge between the teachers and my group which fittest me well. But within the project I had to find the right task for myself like anyone else. I also tried to get everything straight for everyone so each one of us knew what the state of the projects was and what needed to be done, and came up with ideas to make the workflow more effecient.

Most other teammates where of great use. Martti was a beast in programming and a very motivated student till the end. Joanne really kept the group together during the different meetings we had throughout the minor and Eric really came up with brilliant ideas to make sure the project would be a succes. Sefa and Ayrton didn't have much experience with Python so sometimes it was hard for them to keep up. Sefa really did his best with the task he needed to do. He also helped really well when he needed to during the project, despite his non-Python background. Ayrton however felt like he was of less use. unfortunately he didn't say that much and we as a group didn't know if he understanded it all. We often offered him a helping hand but I don't think he ever was willing to use it. which is a shame since he is a great guy.

The first 12 weeks the group gathered as a whole at the THUAS at The Hague on Monday and Wednesdsay. On Thuesday, Thursday Joanne, Eric and I gathered at the THUAS at Delft, and friday we all gathered for the weekly meetings with the teachers at Delft. Monday and Wednessday we had group meetings where we would update the Trello board (see example) and see the results of each individual. The last 12 weeks we only gathered at the THUAS at The Hague at Monday when there where lectures, but eventually we would spend all days at Delft where we would meet as a whole on Friday before we had the meetings with the teachers. Below I will reflect on a problem I solves within the group using an efficient working method.

### **Working method** 
#### **Situation** 
Within the group there where a lot of frustrations because people couldn't catch up with each other and could't contribute as much to the project as they wanted.  

#### **Task** 
My task was to make sure that everyone would stay motivated for the projects and to make sure that they could keep up with what was happening.

#### **Action** 
I had a couple of converstations with members of the group and where they where the most frustrated about. Then I discovered that they couldn't keep up as much as they wanted. So I thought of a plan to make it work between the group members and came up with the idea to work parallel where anyone would make there own reinforcement learning model.

#### **Result**
Theresult is that anyone would work parallel on there own reinforcement learning model so that anyone could contribute as much to the project as they wanted. This led to 4 different types of usefull models that we could use on the COFANO proplem. We also gained a lot of knowledge about the different methods and this was of great value.

#### **Reflection** 
I am glad that the idea of working parallel really worked. I am certainly going to use this in future reseaches when I am working in groups.
